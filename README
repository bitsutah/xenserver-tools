vm-backup-xva.py

Is a semi-interactive script that iterates through all running VMs in a Xenserver pool and creates an .xva export to a mountpoint.

The variables at the top of the script are there for you to populate with target info.

The script will look at your iscsi lvm data stores and ask you which one to use for temporary VM storage during the backup.

Tested and seems to work on Xenserver 6.5, 7.0 and 7.2 versions.

If this thing nukes your production Xenserver pool, and/or ruins every VM you have, that's your fault for running random code you found on the internet.

How it works :

python calling subprocess.Popen shell commands :
xe sr-list    Get list of storage repos
xe vm-list    Get list of VMs
for each vm
  xe vm-snapshot    Take a snapshot
	xe snapshot-copy  Make snapshot into template
	xe vm-install     Make template into temp VM
	xe vif-list       List all NICs on temp VM
	for each NIC
          xe vif-destroy
  xe vm-param-set   Remove host affinity from temp VM
  xe snapshot-uninstall   remove snapshot
  xe template-uninstall   remove template
  xe vm-export    send .xva to mountpoint (NFS etc)
  xe vm-uninstall   remove temp VM
